# Description

The goal of this project is to implement in Elixir using the actor model the Pastry protocol and a simple object access service to prove its usefulness.The specification of the Pastry protocol can be found in the paper 

Pastry: Scalable, decentralized object location and routing for large-scale peer-topeer systems. by A. Rowstron and P. Druschel.

You can find the paper at (http://rowstron.azurewebsites.net/PAST/pastry.pdf) The paper above, in Section 2.3 contains a specification of the Pastry API and of the API to be implemented by the application.
